## Dog Breed Identification Using Transfer Learning
Dog breed identification involves training a machine learning model to classify dog images based on their breed using the VGG19 architecture through transfer learning. This requires a comprehensive dataset of labeled dog images representing various breeds. During training, the model learns breed-specific visual characteristics to improve accuracy. This technology has practical applications in veterinary diagnosis, pet understanding, and dog-related services like adoption and breeding. It also aids in research on genetic and phenotypic traits of different dog breeds.
